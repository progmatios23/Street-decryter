# changelog

## unreleased

- **tls callbacks, first class**: pe tls callbacks are kept on the binary, listed
  with addresses in file info, exposed as `ceasta.tls_callbacks()`, and the new
  **Debug → Break on tls callbacks** (on by default) puts breakpoints on them
  when a debug session starts — so the listing follows code that runs before the
  entry point. plugin: `tls_review.lua`
- **protect this machine** (on by default): attach refuses ceasta itself, its
  parent, and critical os processes (windows: System / csrss / lsass / ...;
  linux: pid 1, kernel threads, systemd/init). the attach dialog marks them.
  lua: `ceasta.host_protect_reason(pid)`. plugin: `host_guard.lua`
- **watch for host crash / BSOD** (on by default): while debugging, ceasta
  notices a big wall-clock jump or a critical process vanishing and raises a
  `host_alert` event (and a log line). toggle under the Debug menu

## v0.12.0 - 2026-09-25

- **macos**: `ceasta-x.y.z-macos.dmg` (the app) and `ceasta-cli-x.y.z-macos.tar.gz`, one build
  for apple silicon and intel, macos 11 or newer. the app uses the system's open / save panels
  and cmd for the shortcuts; plugins you add go in `~/Library/Application Support/ceasta`.
  signed ad-hoc, not notarized: the first launch needs right-click > open (or open anyway in
  privacy & security). no debugger on macos yet
- **mach-o files**, on every system: macos / ios programs, libraries, bundles and object
  files, x86_64 and arm64 (arm64e too), and universal files (`--arch x64|arm64`, the palette's
  "part" actions, and a `.ceasta` file remembers which part). imports come from dyld's bind
  info or chained fixups (the pointers are decoded, so data reads right), stubs call imports by
  name, exports from the export trie, exact function starts, and c++ / rust landing pads stay
  inside their function. names lose mach-o's leading underscore (`printf`, not `_printf`), so
  prototypes and calls that don't return are known
- **file info for mach-o**: minimum os and sdk, uuid, libraries and rpaths, pie / nx / canary /
  fortify / pac, the code signature (signer and team, ad-hoc, hardened runtime, library
  validation) and the entitlements, with warnings for the ones that let code in
  (get-task-allow, disable-library-validation, dyld environment variables, jit), fairplay
  encryption, upx and overlays
- kuna reads mach-o files too (a universal file's part is handed over on its own)
- analysis: in a file that lists every function start, code found by heuristics (a switch
  nobody resolved, a pointer into the middle) stays in the function around it; an
  instruction decoded past a call that doesn't return can't swallow the next function
- fixes: "open my plugins folder" works on linux too; a client hanging up on the http mcp
  server can't end ceasta with SIGPIPE; a kuna run finished while debugging on linux doesn't
  wait out its time limit

## v0.11.0 - 2026-09-25

- **arm64**: pe (windows on arm) and elf (linux) arm64 programs open next to x86 / x64 ones -
  listing, graph, xrefs, strings, switch tables, import stubs, signatures and diff. addresses
  built over two instructions (adrp + add / ldr) read as names (`adrp x0, aHello@page` /
  `add x0, x0, aHello@pageoff  ; "hello"`), calls through the got name the import, and the
  switch tables gcc, clang and msvc make are followed. raw arm64 code: file > open raw,
  `--raw-arm64`. the decompiler and the debugger are still x86 / x64 only, and say so
- **the linux gui is a download**: `ceasta-x.y.z-linux-x64.AppImage` - chmod +x and run
  (ubuntu 22.04 or newer and the like). the cli tarball is built on 22.04 too now
- **one file for your work, like ida's .i64**: ctrl+s writes `<file>.ceasta` next to the
  program with your names, comments, breakpoints, where you were, and the program itself, so
  it opens later - or on another machine - without the original
- **undo / redo** (ctrl+z / ctrl+y) for names, comments, types, prototypes and bookmarks, and
  **bookmarks** (alt+m marks the line, ctrl+m lists them)
- **a calmer window**: a slimmer toolbar (the debug buttons only while debugging), one small
  view switch (listing / graph / pseudocode / both), and ctrl+shift+p - every action and
  plugin command in one searchable list
- **debugger**
  - step back (shift+f7): steps are recorded, back undoes registers and memory
  - step out (ctrl+f9)
  - conditional breakpoints (shift+f2): `rdi == 3`, `hits == 100`, `str(rcx) == 'admin'`,
    run in a sandbox
  - watchpoints: stop when the program writes (or reads) a variable - f2 on data, or the hex
    view's right click; up to 4, on every thread
  - a call stack tab that works on optimized code without unwind info, and a memory map tab;
    the hex view can show process memory (the heap, a stack)
  - linux: multi-threaded programs, and libraries loaded after start show up by name
- **decompiler**
  - stack variables (`local_1c`, `arg_4`), declared at the top; buffers become arrays
  - calls get their real arguments, 32-bit stack arguments and win64 stores included, and
    imports are called by name: `CreateFileA(arg_0, 0x40000000, 1, 0, 2, 0x80, 0)`
  - ~350 known prototypes (windows api, c library, posix) give the argument count, and the
    listing names what each instruction passes: `mov r8d, 0x30  ; dwLength`
  - click a name and every use lights up: n renames it, y sets a variable's type or edits a
    function's prototype, enter follows it
  - both (shift+f5): the listing and the pseudocode side by side, following each other
- **file info** (the file tab, `ceasta-cli info`, the ai): headers, security flags (aslr, dep,
  cfg, signed / pie, nx, relro, canary, fortify), md5 / sha256 / imphash, sections with
  entropy, resources, version info, and warnings - packed (upx, aspack, themida, vmprotect,
  ...), overlay, tls callbacks, an entry point in an odd section
- **ida, ghidra and x64dbg**: file > export for writes an idapython script, a ghidra script
  or an x64dbg database with your names, comments, prototypes and breakpoints; file > import
  names reads x64dbg databases, .map files and the json of `scripts/ida_to_ceasta.py` /
  `scripts/ghidra_to_ceasta.py`. the same as `ceasta-cli export` / `import`
- **a second decompiler, kuna** (#12): with [kuna](https://github.com/Noelo-Lab/kuna) installed,
  the pseudocode view gets a `ceasta | kuna` switch showing its output for the same function -
  run in the background, kept per function, lines linked to the listing, arm64 included.
  nothing of it is bundled: ceasta runs kuna's command line tool (on PATH, or view > second
  decompiler). also `ceasta-cli decompile --kuna` and the ai's `decompile_with_kuna`
- **ai**: ready-made mcp prompts (triage, explain_function, rename_pass, find_crypto,
  trace_function) and names you review before they're applied (ai > review suggested names);
  new tools for variables, prototypes, watchpoints, stepping back and out, and the memory map
- analysis: elf unwind tables give exact function starts (gcc's `.cold` parts stay inside
  their function), and a tail jump to an import stub no longer grows the caller over
  everything in between
- fixes: long listings could never scroll their last rows into view; a listing that comes
  back into view scrolls to the cursor

## v0.10.0 - 2026-09-25

- search everything (ctrl+f, edit > search, the toolbar): functions, names, imports, exports,
  strings, comments and segments in one box - exact matches first, up / down / enter to jump,
  and strings say where they're used. the info panel's box searches its lists and the tabs
  count the matches. `ceasta-cli search <file> <text>` does the same from a terminal
- debugger: a steps box by the step buttons (and in the debug menu) - f7 / f8 run that many
  instructions at once without freezing the window; a breakpoint, a fault or the exit ends it
  early, and the output gets one line instead of one per instruction
- the ai server in the app: ai > connect an ai starts the mcp server for the open file and shows
  what to paste into claude code / cursor. the ai works on what you see - its renames, comments
  and breakpoints show up live, and its debug session is the window's debugger
- saving: nothing is saved behind your back any more. closing the window, closing the file or
  opening another one asks first (save / don't save / cancel), the title shows a `*` while there
  are unsaved changes, and file > save project as... writes a `.ceasta` project wherever you
  like - open it (ctrl+o or drop it on the window) to pick up where you left off
- mcp over http only answers programs on this machine: requests from web pages of other sites
  and dns-rebinding hosts are refused, and a stalled connection can't hold the server
- linux debugger: the program no longer inherits ceasta's open files and sockets

## v0.9.0 - 2026-09-24

- a built-in mcp server: connect an ai (claude code / desktop, cursor, ...) to the open binary
  - `ceasta-cli mcp <file>` (stdio) or `--http <port>`; read, decompile, xrefs, rename, comment
  - `--allow-debug` adds the debugger tools: breakpoints, stepping, registers, memory, and
    debug_call (call a function and get its result), debug_trace, debug_decompile_here
  - `--allow-lua` adds run_lua. see docs/mcp.md
- call a function in the running program: repl `call`, lua `ceasta.dbg.call`, mcp debug_call
- live pseudocode: stopped in a function, the current line is marked (repl `dec`, mcp)
- runtime xrefs: `trace` records the targets of indirect calls / jumps the program takes
- binary diff: `ceasta-cli diff <old> <new>` and the diff_binary mcp tool
- library signatures: `sigmake` / `sigapply` name known functions in a stripped binary
- project files: names / comments / breakpoints save to a committable `<binary>.ceasta`
- experimental linux gui (glfw + opengl3), off by default (`-DCEASTA_LINUX_GUI=ON`)

## v0.8.2 - 2026-09-24

- decompiler fixes - it could print code that doesn't do what the program does
  - values a later block reads were dropped: a loop could lose its counter increment, a function its return value
  - nothing reads a register after it changed any more, when an assignment has to be written out early
  - calls get their real arguments: functions in the binary are checked for what they read, and values a compiler keeps in registers across a call to a small function survive it
  - setcc, cmov, div / idiv, mul, rol / ror, bswap, popcnt are lifted (`rax == 5`, `a ? b : c`, `/` and `%`, `__rol(x, 5)`); anything else shows as `__asm { ... }` instead of vanishing
  - loops with more than one exit, top-tested loops that compute before their test, and tail calls (a jump into another function, or through a pointer) come out right
  - switch cases are written inside the switch, and functions whose result no caller reads are `void`
  - every goto has its label - a jump back to code that was already written had none
- the pseudocode screenshot shows the new switch output
- the linux download's release note mentions the terminal debugger

## v0.8.1 - 2026-09-24

- licensed under GPLv3 - the license now ships in the installer, the zip and the linux download

## v0.7.0 - 2026-09-24

- decompiler: c-like pseudocode for a function (f5, or the Pseudocode tab)
  - lifts x86 / x64 to expressions, recovers conditions from the flags
  - structures the control flow: if / else, while, do / while, switch, gotos only where needed
  - names calls, arguments from the calling convention, string and global names
